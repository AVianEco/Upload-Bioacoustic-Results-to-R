# Upload-Bioacoustic-Results-to-R

## OVERVIEW ##
Basic R-scripts meant for uploading and parsing CSV outputs from popular bioacoustic analysis programs (e.g. Kailedescope, Audacity, Raven) to an R database. These scripts are referenced in our online and in-person introductory courses for bioacoustics.

## USAGE ##
This code is intended to be customized to your specific project. Users will need to open and review the code prior to use. Each script has a pre-amble. The pre-amble contains a section called "User Modifications Required". This section describes which portions of code are customizeable to the user's project.
