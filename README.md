# Upload-Bioacoustic-Results-to-R

## OVERVIEW ##
Basic R-scripts meant for uploading and parsing CSV outputs from popular bioacoustic analysis programsto an R database. These scripts are referenced in our online and in-person introductory courses for bioacoustics. Most of these scripts contain code to split user-defined, comma-delimited manual annotations into separated columns.

### AVAILABLE SCRIPTS ###
- Upload Annotations from Cornell's RavenLite
- Upload Annotations from Cornell's RavenPro
- Upload Labels from Audacity
- Upload ManualIDs from Wildlife Acoustic's Kailedescope Pro (works for Cluster Analysis and Bat AutoID).

## USAGE ##
This code is intended to be customized to your specific project. Users will need to open and review the code prior to use. Each script has a pre-amble. The pre-amble contains a section called "User Modifications Required". This section describes which portions of code are customizeable to the user's project.
